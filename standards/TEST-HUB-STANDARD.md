# Test-Hub Standard (portable)

A project-agnostic minimum bar for a project's **test/demo hub** — the single page that
demonstrates and drives every feature of an app. This is extracted from golf-finder's
`test.html` + `tests/test-hub.test.mjs` + the `keep-test-hub-in-sync` skill, with the
project-specific parts (weather, loader, sky controls) stripped out.

**Use it like this:** drop this file into a repo, fill in that project's hooks, and a hub
either passes the four-invariant checklist below or it doesn't. "At least as good as
golf-finder" means *all four invariants hold and CI enforces #3*. The buttons differ per
project; the invariants don't.

> The trap to avoid: copying another project's hub *controls* (its weather buttons, its
> loader toggles) and calling it done. Those don't transfer. The four invariants are the
> standard — a hub with a beautiful control rail and no sync-guard is A-tier and already
> rotting.

## The four invariants

### 1. Drives the REAL artifact, never a copy
The hub loads the actual production build (same-origin, typically in an `<iframe>`) and
exercises it through public hooks. It re-implements **zero** app logic. The instant a hub
mocks, forks, or re-derives app behaviour, it tests a fiction and will pass while the app
is broken.

- ✅ Hub embeds the shipped artifact and calls into it.
- ❌ Hub contains a second copy of any feature, even "just for the demo".

### 2. Every demoable state is a public hook, in two flavours
A state you can only reach by clicking through the app by hand is not yet a hook. Expose it
two ways:

- **Declarative — URL params** (`?time=21:00`, `?wx=storm`). Deep-linkable, shareable,
  scriptable, works on first paint, no console needed.
- **Live — console/JS helpers** (`setWx('storm')`, `toggleCompass()`). Flip state with no
  reload, drive same-origin from the hub.

Rule: anything worth demoing gets both a URL form (for sharing/first-paint) and a live form
(for no-reload driving), unless one is genuinely impossible (e.g. a first-paint-only splash
can't read a runtime URL — document the exception).

### 3. A CI sync-guard that fails on drift  ← the S+/A divider
A test, run in CI on every PR, that asserts the hub and the app agree on the hook set
**both directions**:
- add a hook to the app → guard fails until the hub exposes it;
- rename/drop a hook → guard fails and names the now-dead hub control.

Without this, the hub silently dies the first time a hook is renamed: the button still
renders, it just does nothing, and nobody notices until a live demo. With it, drift is a
red build that tells you exactly what to fix.

**Source of truth for the hook list — pick the strongest your project supports:**
- *Build/module project:* import the hook registry and assert against it (robust, refactor-safe).
- *No build step (single-file app like golf-finder):* parse both files as **text** and match
  hook tokens. Less robust, but real — golf-finder's guard does exactly this.

Either way the principle is identical: **hub and app share one source of truth for which
hooks exist, and CI proves they're in step.**

### 4. A written process so the guard can't be out-run
A skill / CONTRIBUTING note / CLAUDE.md section making this one atomic change:

> **add hook → add hub control → extend guard → update docs** — all in the same PR.

The guard catches drift after the fact; the process stops it being introduced. Both are
required: a guard with no process means people add hooks and skip the hub; a process with no
guard means people forget the process.

## Recommended extras (not gates, but cheap wins)
- **Escape-hatches for feel/sensor features** — gate anything whose *feel* can only be
  judged on real hardware behind a `window._featureName` flag (default on) so it degrades
  safely and can be A/B'd on-device. (golf-finder: `window._tiltPan`, `window._camAz`,
  `window._skySwipe`.)
- **Responsive hub** — the control rail and the app preview shouldn't fight for the same
  pixels on a phone. Either side-by-side (desktop) or a stage-then-launch overlay (mobile).
- **`noindex`** the hub — it's a tool, not a public page.
- **No separate deploy** — serve the hub from the same origin as the app so there's no
  second publish step to forget.

## Conformance checklist (a hub is "≥ standard" only if every box is ticked)

- [ ] **I1** Hub loads the real shipped artifact same-origin; contains no re-implemented app logic.
- [ ] **I2** Every demoable state has a URL-param form AND a live-helper form (exceptions documented).
- [ ] **I3** A CI test asserts hub↔app hook parity in BOTH directions and fails on drift.
- [ ] **I3a** Hub and app share ONE source of truth for the hook list (imported registry, or text-match if no build).
- [ ] **I4** A written checklist makes "add hook → add hub control → extend guard → update docs" one PR.
- [ ] _(extra)_ Feel/sensor features sit behind `window._*` escape-hatches.
- [ ] _(extra)_ Hub is responsive, `noindex`, and deploys with the app (no separate publish).

## How to stand one up in a new project (≈ half a day)

1. **Inventory the states worth demoing.** Every weather/theme/time/feature-flag/error state
   a stakeholder might want to see. That list becomes your hook set.
2. **Add the hooks to the app** — a URL parser for the declarative forms, exported helpers
   for the live forms, `window._*` flags for the feel-features.
3. **Build the hub** — one same-origin page: a control rail that composes a URL
   (`buildURL()`) for declarative state and calls the live helpers for no-reload driving.
   Embed the real app in an iframe.
4. **Write the guard** — copy `test-hub-guard.template.mjs` (next to this file), fill in your
   project's hook tokens, wire it into CI.
5. **Write the process** — a short skill or CONTRIBUTING section: the four-step atomic change.
6. **Tick the checklist above.** Anything unchecked is the gap between this project and S+.

See `standards/test-hub-guard.template.mjs` in this repo for a ready-to-adapt guard test in
the zero-dependency / text-match style. For the build/module style, replace the text matchers
with an import of your app's hook registry — the assertions (parity both ways) stay the same.
